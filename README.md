## Wireframes

![Barkeeping-proof-of-concept](https://i.imgur.com/IxnI3lm.png)

- 4 Divs (Top rules/lore text, Lower Third w/ button, Monster Image stats, Dice roll w/ results)
- 1 Button to roll the dice


### MVP/PostMVP

#### MVP 

- Pulling in a stat block for the monster using the dnd API(specifically it's "name" and "armor_class")
- Create a dice rolling array to show what the player rolled(1 thru 20)
- Comparing the armor_class of the monster with the dice result from the attack. Greater than the amount = Win!

#### PostMVP  

- Attaching an image to the monster from an outside API
- Add a title screen
- Add a result screen for victory or loss
- Add a simple dice rolling/spinning animation for attacks
- Add more monster possibilities
- Add different modifiers to the dice roll depending on the monster
- Add different ways to beat up monsters

## Code Snippet

Had a lot of fun discovering how to add different things ontop of my main dice roll comparison mechanic 

```
function compare(diceRoll) {
  let loser = " \n LOSER \n -10 HP"
  let winner = " \n WINNER \n 10 DMG"
  let health = document.querySelector('#health-bar')
  if (diceRoll >= monsterArmor) {
    document.querySelector('#results').style.color = "limegreen"
    diceResult.innerText += winner
    monsterHealth -= 10;
    monsterApi.innerText = `NAME: ${monsterName} \n \n ARMOR: ${monsterArmor} \n \n HEALTH: ${monsterHealth}`
    if (monsterHealth <= 0) {
      window.location.replace("win.html")
    }
  } else {
    document.querySelector('#results').style.color = "red"
    diceResult.innerText += loser
    health.value -= 10;
    if (health.value == 0) {
      window.location.replace("lose.html")
    }
  }
}
```

## Change Log
-Changed the random number selection method from picking from an array to picking a random number through a Math.random function.

-Added health mechanic for both the player and the monster.

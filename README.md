## Wireframes

![Barkeeping-proof-of-concept](https://i.imgur.com/IxnI3lm.png)

- 4 Divs (Top rules/lore text, Lower Third w/ button, Monster Image stats, Dice roll w/ results)
- 1 Button to roll the dice


### MVP/PostMVP

#### MVP 

- Pulling in a stat block for the monster using the dnd API(specifically it's "name" and "armor_class")
- Create a dice rolling array to show what the player rolled(1 thru 20)
- Comparing the armor_class of the monster with the dice result from the attack. Greater than the amount = Win!

#### PostMVP  

- Attaching an image to the monster from an outside API
- Add a title screen
- Add a result screen for victory or loss
- Add a simple dice rolling/spinning animation for attacks
- Add more monster possibilities
- Add different modifiers to the dice roll depending on the monster
- Add different ways to beat up monsters
